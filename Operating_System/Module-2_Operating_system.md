## âœ… **1. Processes**

### ðŸ”¹ Definition

A **process** is a **program in execution**.
It is an active entity with:

* Code (text section)
* Data (global, stack, heap)
* Program Counter (PC)
* CPU registers
* State, resources, and scheduling information

---

### ðŸ”¹ Process Relationships

* **Parent â†’ Child** via system calls (e.g., `fork()` in UNIX).
* **Tree of processes**: each child can create its own child processes.

Example:

```bash
init (PID 1)
â”œâ”€â”€ bash (PID 1001)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ nano (PID 1002)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ python (PID 1003)
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ States of a Process

A process typically goes through the following **5 states**:

| State           | Description                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| New             | Process is being created           |
| Ready           | Waiting to be assigned to CPU      |
| Running         | Instructions are being executed    |
| Waiting/Blocked | Waiting for some event (e.g., I/O) |
| Terminated      | Finished execution                 |

---

### ðŸ”¹ Process State Transition Diagram

```plaintext
NEW â†’ READY â†’ RUNNING â†’ TERMINATED  
          â†“      â†‘  
        WAITING (Blocked)  
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Process Control Block (PCB)

The **PCB** is a data structure maintained by the OS for each process.

**Contains:**

* Process ID (PID)
* Program Counter
* CPU Registers
* Scheduling info (priority, queues)
* Memory info (page tables, limits)
* I/O status, file descriptors

PCB is **loaded during context switch**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Context Switching

When CPU switches from one process to another:

* Saves the state (PCB) of the old process
* Loads the PCB of the new process
* Incurred **context switch overhead** (CPU cycles wasted)

**Fast context switching = better performance**

---

## âœ… **2. Threads**

### ðŸ”¹ Definition

A **thread** is the **smallest unit of CPU execution** within a process.
A process can have **multiple threads**, sharing the same memory and resources.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Benefits of Threads

1. **Faster Context Switching** (no need to load separate PCB)
2. **Shared Memory** = easy data communication
3. **Improved Responsiveness** (UI thread vs background thread)
4. **Better CPU Utilization** on multicore systems

---

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Threads

* **User-Level Threads (ULT):** Managed by user libraries (faster but limited by single core)
* **Kernel-Level Threads (KLT):** Managed by OS (true parallelism, higher overhead)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Thread States

Same as processes: New, Ready, Running, Blocked, Terminated

---

### ðŸ”¹ Multithreading

Allows multiple threads to run **concurrently** within the same process.

**Example:**

* Word Processor:

  * Thread 1: GUI
  * Thread 2: Spell check
  * Thread 3: Auto-save

---

## âœ… **3. Process Scheduling**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Foundation & Objectives

**Goal:** Decide *which process/thread to run next* to improve performance.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Schedulers

| Scheduler Type  | Role                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Long-term**   | Loads jobs into memory (job scheduler)   |
| **Short-term**  | Picks one process from ready queue (CPU) |
| **Medium-term** | Swaps processes in/out of memory         |

---

### ðŸ”¹ Scheduling Criteria

| Criterion       | Meaning                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| CPU Utilization | Keep CPU busy as much as possible           |
| Throughput      | Number of processes completed per unit time |
| Turnaround Time | Completion time âˆ’ Arrival time              |
| Waiting Time    | Time spent in ready queue                   |
| Response Time   | Time to respond to a request                |

---

### ðŸ”¹ Scheduling Algorithms

#### âœ… **1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**

* Non-preemptive
* Scheduled in the order of arrival
* **Problem:** Convoy effect (long job delays others)

#### âœ… **2. Shortest Job First (SJF)**

* Can be preemptive or non-preemptive
* Selects process with **shortest burst time**
* **Optimal** in terms of average waiting time
* **Problem:** Can cause starvation

#### âœ… **3. Round Robin (RR)**

* **Preemptive**
* Each process gets **time quantum** (e.g., 10ms)
* If not completed, goes back to the queue
* **Good for time-sharing**

**Example:**

```plaintext
Ready Queue: P1, P2, P3  
Quantum = 4ms  
P1 (6ms) â†’ executes 4ms, goes back with 2ms  
P2 (3ms) â†’ completes  
...
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Multiprocessor Scheduling

Used in systems with **multiple CPUs or cores**.

**Types:**

* **Symmetric (SMP):** All processors are equal
* **Asymmetric:** One CPU is the master, rest execute assigned tasks

**Challenge:** Load balancing and processor affinity

---

### ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Scheduling

Used in **embedded systems, avionics, robotics**, etc.

#### âœ… **1. Rate Monotonic (RM)**

* Static priority assigned based on frequency.
* More frequent = higher priority
* Suitable for **periodic tasks**
* **Preemptive**

#### âœ… **2. Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**

* Dynamic priority based on **earliest deadline**
* **Optimal** for uniprocessors

Completion Times:
P1 = 10, P2 = 8, P3 = 5
