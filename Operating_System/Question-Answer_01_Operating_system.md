---

## 📘 **Module 1 – Introduction & OS Structures**

### Q1. What is an operating system? List its main functions with examples.

**A:** An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that acts as an interface between hardware and user applications, controlling and coordinating the use of hardware among various programs.

**Key Functions:**
1. **Process Management:** Creates, schedules, terminates processes (e.g., running multiple applications)
2. **Memory Management:** Allocates RAM dynamically, prevents unauthorized access
3. **File System Management:** Handles files/directories (e.g., `open()`, `read()`, `write()`)
4. **I/O Management:** Controls input/output devices (keyboard, printer, disk)
5. **Security & Protection:** User authentication, access rights, malware prevention
6. **Networking & Communication:** Supports data transfer across devices

**Example:** When you open Chrome, OS allocates CPU time, memory, handles file/network access automatically.

### Q4. Explain monolithic, layered, and microkernel OS structures with detailed comparison.

**A:**

**Monolithic Kernel:**
- Entire OS runs as single large program in kernel mode
- All services (file system, device drivers, memory management) in kernel space
- **Advantages:** Fast execution, low overhead, simple communication
- **Disadvantages:** Hard to maintain/debug, one bug crashes entire system
- **Examples:** Early UNIX, MS-DOS, Linux

**Layered OS:**
- OS divided into hierarchical layers
- Each layer provides services to layer above
- Layer 0: Hardware, Layer N: User interface
- **Advantages:** Modular design, easier debugging, clear interfaces
- **Disadvantages:** Performance overhead, difficult to define layers
- **Example:** THE OS

**Microkernel:**
- Minimal kernel with only core functions (IPC, basic scheduling)
- Other services (file system, device drivers) run in user space
- **Advantages:** Modular, secure, fault isolation, easy to extend
- **Disadvantages:** Performance overhead due to message passing
- **Examples:** MINIX, QNX, Mach

---

### Q5. What are system calls? Classify them with detailed examples and explain their implementation.

**A:** **System calls** are programming interfaces that allow user programs to request services from the OS kernel.

**Why needed:** Applications cannot directly access hardware; OS provides secure, controlled interfaces.

**Classification:**

**1. Process Control:**
- `fork()`: Create new process
- `exit()`: Terminate process
- `wait()`: Wait for child process
- `exec()`: Execute new program

**2. File Management:**
- `open()`: Open file
- `read()`: Read from file
- `write()`: Write to file
- `close()`: Close file
- `lseek()`: Move file pointer

**3. Device Management:**
- `ioctl()`: Device-specific operations
- `read()/write()`: Device I/O

**4. Information Maintenance:**
- `getpid()`: Get process ID
- `alarm()`: Set alarm
- `sleep()`: Suspend process

**5. Communication:**
- `pipe()`: Create pipe for IPC
- `send()/recv()`: Network communication

**Implementation Example:**
```c
int fd = open("data.txt", O_RDONLY);
if (fd == -1) {
    perror("Error opening file");
    return -1;
}
```

```
Host OS
├── VM Monitor/Hypervisor
    ├── Guest OS 1 (Windows)
    ├── Guest OS 2 (Linux)
    └── Guest OS 3 (MacOS)
```

**Types:**
1. **Type 1 (Bare Metal):** Hypervisor runs directly on hardware (VMware ESXi, Hyper-V)
2. **Type 2 (Hosted):** Hypervisor runs on host OS (VirtualBox, VMware Workstation)

**Benefits:**
- **Isolation:** VMs are independent; crash in one doesn't affect others
- **Resource Utilization:** Better hardware usage
- **Testing:** Safe environment for testing
- **Portability:** Easy migration between physical machines
- **Security:** Sandboxed environments

## 📘 **Module 2 – Processes, Threads & Scheduling**

### Q7. Define process and explain process states with state transition diagram.

**A:** A **process** is a program in execution with its own memory space, CPU state, and system resources.

**Process States:**
1. **New:** Process being created
2. **Ready:** Waiting for CPU assignment
3. **Running:** Instructions being executed
4. **Waiting/Blocked:** Waiting for I/O or event
5. **Terminated:** Finished execution

**State Transition Diagram:**
```
NEW → READY ⟷ RUNNING → TERMINATED
        ↑        ↓
      WAITING/BLOCKED
```

**Transitions:**
- New → Ready: Process created and loaded
- Ready → Running: Scheduler assigns CPU
- Running → Ready: Time quantum expires (preemption)
- Running → Waiting: I/O request or wait for event
- Waiting → Ready: I/O complete or event occurs
- Running → Terminated: Process completes

---

### Q8. Explain Process Control Block (PCB) and context switching in detail.

**A:** **Process Control Block (PCB)** is a data structure maintained by OS for each process.

**PCB Contents:**
- **Process ID (PID):** Unique identifier
- **Process State:** Current state (ready, running, etc.)
- **Program Counter:** Address of next instruction
- **CPU Registers:** All register values
- **Scheduling Information:** Priority, queue pointers
- **Memory Management:** Page tables, segment tables
- **I/O Status:** Open files, I/O devices
- **Accounting Information:** CPU time used, time limits

**Context Switching:**
Process of switching CPU from one process to another.

**Steps:**
1. Save current process state in its PCB
2. Update PCB with new state information
3. Move PCB to appropriate queue
4. Select new process for execution
5. Load new process state from its PCB
6. Jump to new process location

**Overhead:** Time spent in context switching is pure overhead.

### Q9. Compare processes and threads with detailed examples.

**A:**

| Aspect | Process | Thread |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Definition** | Program in execution | Lightweight process within a process |
| **Memory** | Separate address space | Shared address space |
| **Creation Time** | High (fork overhead) | Low (minimal setup) |
| **Communication** | IPC mechanisms needed | Direct memory sharing |
| **Context Switch** | Expensive | Cheap |
| **Protection** | Protected from each other | No protection between threads |
| **Failure Impact** | Isolated | One thread crash affects all |

**Example - Word Processor:**
- **Process Approach:** Separate processes for spell-check, auto-save
- **Thread Approach:** Main thread for UI, background threads for spell-check, auto-save

**Thread Types:**
- **User-Level Threads:** Managed by user libraries (fast, limited parallelism)
- **Kernel-Level Threads:** Managed by OS (true parallelism, higher overhead)

---

### Q10. Explain scheduling algorithms with Gantt charts and performance analysis.

**A:**

**FCFS (First-Come, First-Served):**
- Non-preemptive
- Processes executed in arrival order

**Example:** P1(BT=5), P2(BT=3), P3(BT=8), all arrive at t=0

Gantt Chart:
```
| P1 | P2 | P3 |
0    5    8    16
```

Average Waiting Time = (0+5+8)/3 = 4.33 ms

**SJF (Shortest Job First):**
- Selects process with shortest burst time
- Optimal for average waiting time

**Example:** Same processes, reordered by burst time
```
| P2 | P1 | P3 |
0    3    8    16
```

Average Waiting Time = (0+3+8)/3 = 3.67 ms

**Round Robin:**
- Preemptive with time quantum
- Good for time-sharing systems

**Example:** Same processes, quantum = 2ms
```
| P1 | P2 | P3 | P1 | P3 | P1 | P3 |
0    2    4    6    8   10   12   16
```

### Q11. Explain multiprocessor scheduling and real-time scheduling algorithms.

**A:**

**Multiprocessor Scheduling:**

**Types:**
1. **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):** All processors equal, any can run any process
2. **Asymmetric Multiprocessing:** Master-slave relationship

**Challenges:**
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute work evenly
- **Processor Affinity:** Keep process on same CPU for cache efficiency
- **Migration:** Moving processes between processors

**Real-Time Scheduling:**

**Rate Monotonic (RM):**
- Static priority assignment
- Higher frequency = higher priority
- Optimal for fixed priority systems

**Example:** 
- Task A: Period 20ms → Priority 1
- Task B: Period 50ms → Priority 2

**Earliest Deadline First (EDF):**
- Dynamic priority based on deadline
- Earliest deadline = highest priority
- Optimal for uniprocessor systems

## 📘 **Module 3 – Inter-Process Communication & Synchronization**

### Q12. Explain the critical section problem with Peterson's algorithm implementation.

**A:** **Critical Section** is code segment where shared resources are accessed.

**Requirements:**
1. **Mutual Exclusion:** Only one process in critical section
2. **Progress:** Selection of next process must not be postponed indefinitely
3. **Bounded Waiting:** Limit on waiting time

**Peterson's Algorithm:**
```c
boolean flag[2] = {false, false};
int turn = 0;

// Process Pi
do {
    flag[i] = true;        // Show interest
    turn = j;              // Give other priority
    while(flag[j] && turn == j); // Wait
    
    // Critical Section
    
    flag[i] = false;       // Exit
    
    // Remainder Section
} while(true);
```

**Analysis:** Satisfies all three requirements for two-process synchronization.

---

### Q13. Solve the Producer-Consumer problem using semaphores with detailed code.

**A:** **Problem:** Producer creates data, Consumer consumes data through shared buffer.

**Solution using Semaphores:**
```c
semaphore empty = n;    // Empty slots
semaphore full = 0;     // Full slots  
semaphore mutex = 1;    // Mutual exclusion

// Producer
do {
    wait(empty);        // Wait for empty slot
    wait(mutex);        // Enter critical section
    
    // Add item to buffer
    
    signal(mutex);      // Exit critical section
    signal(full);       // Signal full slot
} while(true);

// Consumer  
do {
    wait(full);         // Wait for full slot
    wait(mutex);        // Enter critical section
    
    // Remove item from buffer
    
    signal(mutex);      // Exit critical section  
    signal(empty);      // Signal empty slot
} while(true);
```

### Q14. Compare different IPC mechanisms with advantages and use cases.

**A:**

| Method | Speed | Complexity | Use Case | Example |
|--------|-------|------------|----------|---------|
| **Shared Memory** | Fastest | High (synchronization needed) | Large data transfer | Database systems |
| **Message Passing** | Moderate | Low (OS handles sync) | Distributed systems | Client-server |
| **Pipes** | Fast | Low | Parent-child communication | Shell commands |
| **Sockets** | Slow | Moderate | Network communication | Web services |
| **Signals** | Fast | Low | Event notification | Process termination |

---

### Q15. Explain classical synchronization problems with solutions.

**A:**

**Readers-Writers Problem:**
- Multiple readers can read simultaneously
- Writers need exclusive access

**Solution (Reader Priority):**
```c
semaphore readMutex = 1, writeMutex = 1;
int readCount = 0;

// Reader
wait(readMutex);
readCount++;
if(readCount == 1) wait(writeMutex);
signal(readMutex);

// Read data

wait(readMutex);
readCount--;
if(readCount == 0) signal(writeMutex);
signal(readMutex);

// Writer
wait(writeMutex);
// Write data
signal(writeMutex);
```

**Dining Philosophers Problem:**
- 5 philosophers, 5 chopsticks
- Each needs 2 chopsticks to eat
- Avoid deadlock and starvation

**Solution:** Pick up chopsticks in order (lower numbered first) to prevent circular wait.

---

## 📘 **Module 4 – Deadlocks**

### Q16. Explain deadlock with real-world examples and necessary conditions.

**A:** **Deadlock** occurs when processes wait indefinitely for resources held by each other.

**Real-world Example:** 
Two cars approaching narrow bridge from opposite directions - each waiting for other to back up.

**Coffman's Conditions (all must hold):**

1. **Mutual Exclusion:** Resource can't be shared
   - Example: Printer can be used by only one process

2. **Hold and Wait:** Process holds resources while waiting for others
   - Example: Process holds file A, waits for file B

3. **No Preemption:** Resources can't be forcibly taken
   - Example: Can't forcibly take printer from running job

4. **Circular Wait:** Circular chain of waiting processes
   - Example: P1 waits for P2, P2 waits for P3, P3 waits for P1

---

### Q17. Explain Banker's Algorithm with detailed example and implementation.

**A:** **Banker's Algorithm** prevents deadlock by ensuring system stays in safe state.

**Data Structures:**
- **Available[m]:** Available instances of each resource
- **Max[n][m]:** Maximum demand of each process
- **Allocation[n][m]:** Currently allocated resources
- **Need[n][m]:** Remaining resource need

**Example:**
5 processes (P0-P4), 3 resource types (A=10, B=5, C=7)

```
Process | Allocation | Max | Need
        | A B C      | A B C| A B C
P0      | 0 1 0      | 7 5 3| 7 4 3
P1      | 2 0 0      | 3 2 2| 1 2 2  
P2      | 3 0 2      | 9 0 2| 6 0 0
P3      | 2 1 1      | 2 2 2| 0 1 1
P4      | 0 0 2      | 4 3 3| 4 3 1

Available: 3 3 2
```

**Safety Check:**
1. Find process whose need ≤ available
2. Assume it completes, add its allocation to available
3. Repeat until all processes complete

**Safe Sequence:** P1 → P3 → P4 → P2 → P0

---

### Q18. Compare deadlock prevention, avoidance, detection, and recovery strategies.

**A:**

| Strategy | Approach | Cost | When Used |
|----------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Prevention** | Break one Coffman condition | Low runtime, may waste resources | Systems where deadlock unacceptable |
| **Avoidance** | Keep system in safe state | Moderate, need advance info | Systems with known resource requirements |
| **Detection** | Allow deadlocks, detect and recover | Low prevention, high recovery | Systems where deadlocks rare |
| **Ignore** | Do nothing | Lowest | Most operating systems |

**Prevention Methods:**
- **Mutual Exclusion:** Make resources shareable (not always possible)
- **Hold and Wait:** Request all resources at once
- **No Preemption:** Allow resource preemption
- **Circular Wait:** Order resources, request in order

**Recovery Methods:**
- **Process Termination:** Kill one or all deadlocked processes
- **Resource Preemption:** Take resources from some processes

## 📘 **Module 5 – Memory Management**

### Q19. Explain paging and segmentation with detailed comparison and examples.

**A:**

**Paging:**
- Fixed-size blocks (pages in logical memory, frames in physical memory)
- Logical address = (Page Number, Offset)
- Page table maps pages to frames

**Example:** 
- Page size = 4KB
- Logical address 8196 = Page 2, Offset 4
- If Page 2 maps to Frame 6, Physical address = 6 × 4KB + 4 = 24580

**Segmentation:**
- Variable-size blocks based on logical divisions
- Segments: code, data, stack, heap
- Logical address = (Segment Number, Offset)

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Paging | Segmentation |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Size** | Fixed | Variable |
| **Fragmentation** | Internal only | External possible |
| **User Visibility** | Hidden from user | Visible to user |
| **Sharing** | Difficult | Easy (whole segments) |
| **Protection** | Page-level | Segment-level |

---

### Q20. Explain virtual memory, demand paging, and page replacement algorithms.

**A:** **Virtual Memory** allows execution of processes larger than physical memory through demand paging.

**Demand Paging:**
- Load pages only when needed
- Page fault triggers loading from disk
- Reduces memory requirements

**Page Fault Handling:**
1. Check if reference is valid
2. Find free frame
3. Load page from disk to frame
4. Update page table
5. Restart instruction

**Page Replacement Algorithms:**

**FIFO (First-In-First-Out):**
```
Reference: 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3
Frames=3:  [7] [7,0] [7,0,1] [2,0,1] [2,0,1] [2,3,1] [0,3,1] [0,3,4] [0,2,4] [3,2,4]
Faults:    F   F     F       F       -       F       F       F       F       F
```
Total Faults: 9

**LRU (Least Recently Used):**
```
Reference: 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3  
Frames=3:  [7] [7,0] [7,0,1] [2,0,1] [2,0,1] [2,0,3] [2,0,3] [4,0,3] [4,2,3] [4,2,3]
Faults:    F   F     F       F       -       F       -       F       F       -
```
Total Faults: 7

**Optimal:**
- Replace page that will be used farthest in future
- Not practical but used for comparison

- Dynamic file growth

**Disadvantages:**
- Index block overhead
- May need multiple index levels for large files

---

### Q22. Compare disk scheduling algorithms with examples and performance analysis.

**A:** **Disk scheduling** minimizes seek time by optimizing head movement.

**Example:** Queue: 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67
Current head position: 53

**FCFS (First-Come-First-Served):**
Movement: 53→98→183→37→122→14→124→65→67
Total seek time: 45+85+146+85+108+110+59+2 = 640

**SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First):**
Movement: 53→65→67→37→14→98→122→124→183
Total seek time: 12+2+30+23+84+24+2+59 = 236

**SCAN (Elevator Algorithm):**
Movement: 53→37→14→0→65→67→98→122→124→183
Total seek time: 16+23+14+65+2+31+24+2+59 = 236

**C-SCAN (Circular SCAN):**
Movement: 53→65→67→98→122→124→183→199→0→14→37
Total seek time: 12+2+31+24+2+59+16+199+14+23 = 382

**Analysis:** SSTF and SCAN perform best, but SCAN provides more uniform response time.

## 📝 **Additional Question Types**

### Q25. Numerical Problems - Calculate average waiting time and turnaround time for given scheduling scenarios.

**A:** **Problem:** Given processes with arrival times and burst times, calculate performance metrics.

**Example:**
```
Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time
P1      | 0           | 6
P2      | 1           | 8  
P3      | 2           | 7
P4      | 3           | 3
```

**FCFS Solution:**
```
Gantt Chart: |P1|P2|P3|P4|
            0  6 14 21 24

Completion Time: P1=6, P2=14, P3=21, P4=24
Turnaround Time: P1=6, P2=13, P3=19, P4=21
Waiting Time: P1=0, P2=5, P3=12, P4=18

Average WT = (0+5+12+18)/4 = 8.75
Average TAT = (6+13+19+21)/4 = 14.75
```

### Q26. Design Problems - Design a simple file system or memory management scheme.

**A:** **Design a simple file allocation system:**

**Requirements:**
- Support files up to 1MB
- Block size = 1KB
- Minimize fragmentation
- Support random access

**Solution - Indexed Allocation:**
```c
struct FileControlBlock {
    char filename[32];
    int file_size;
    int index_block;
    time_t created;
    int permissions;
};

struct IndexBlock {
    int direct_blocks[250];  // Direct pointers
    int indirect_block;      // Single indirect
    int double_indirect;     // Double indirect  
};
```

This supports files up to 250KB direct + 250×250KB indirect = ~62MB
