## ‚úÖ **Module 3: Pipelining and Parallel Processing**

**Lecture Hours: 10**

---

### üî∑ 1. **Pipelining ‚Äì Basic Concepts**

#### üß† What is Pipelining?

* Technique to **overlap instruction execution**.
* Like an assembly line: fetch one instruction while decoding another and executing a third.
* Goal: **Improve CPU throughput**, not latency.

---

#### üîπ Pipeline Stages (Typical 5-Stage):

1. **IF** ‚Äì Instruction Fetch
2. **ID** ‚Äì Instruction Decode
3. **EX** ‚Äì Execute
4. **MEM** ‚Äì Memory Access
5. **WB** ‚Äì Write Back

Each instruction moves through these stages one step at a time.

> Like in a washing machine factory: one shirt washes, one rinses, one dries.

### üî∑ 2. **Throughput and Speedup**

#### Definitions:

* **Throughput**: Number of instructions completed per unit time.
* **Speedup** = Time (non-pipelined) / Time (pipelined)

#### Ideal Case:

* For n instructions and k stages:

  * Non-pipelined time = n √ó k
  * Pipelined time ‚âà k + (n - 1)
  * Speedup ‚âà n / (k + n - 1)

> Real speedup is **less** due to hazards and stalls.

### üî∑ 3. **Pipeline Hazards**

Hazards are situations that **prevent the next instruction** from executing in the next cycle.

| Type           | Cause                                     | Example                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Structural** | Resource conflict                         | Memory or ALU shared            |
| **Data**       | Instruction depends on result of previous | ADD R1, R2, R3 ‚Üí SUB R4, R1, R5 |
| **Control**    | Branching or jumps                        | IF condition is unknown         |

#### Fixes:

* **Stalling**: Insert bubbles (idle cycles)
* **Forwarding**: Pass result directly to next stage
* **Branch Prediction**: Guess path of branch instruction

### üî∑ 4. **Parallel Processors**

#### What is it?

* Systems with **multiple processors/cores**.
* Perform multiple tasks **simultaneously**.

---

### üîπ Types of Parallelism:

| Type                        | Example                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Instruction Level (ILP)** | Pipelining, superscalar                       |
| **Thread Level**            | Multithreading                                |
| **Data Level**              | SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data), GPUs |
| **Task Level**              | Distributed systems                           |

---

### üî∑ 5. **Concurrent Access to Memory**

* In multiprocessors, multiple CPUs may access shared memory simultaneously.
* Issues: **Race conditions**, **data inconsistency**

---

### üî∑ 6. **Cache Coherency**

Problem:

* Each CPU core may have its **own cache**.
* If one updates a memory block, others may have **outdated versions**.

#### üîÅ Solution: Cache Coherence Protocols

1. **Write-through**: Write updates to both cache and memory.
2. **MESI Protocol**: Maintains four states (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid)
3. **Snooping / Directory-based** coherence
