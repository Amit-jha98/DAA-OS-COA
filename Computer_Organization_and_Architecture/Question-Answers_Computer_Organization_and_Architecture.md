## Module 1: Functional Blocks & Data Representation (10 Hours)

### 1. **Explain the functional blocks of a computer system and their interconnections.**

**Answer:**
A computer system consists of four main functional blocks:

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The brain of the computer that executes instructions. It contains:
  - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for computations
  - Control Unit for instruction decoding and execution control
  - Registers for temporary data storage

- **Memory Subsystem:** Stores programs and data
  - Primary memory (RAM) for current programs/data
  - Secondary storage for permanent data storage

- **Input-Output Subsystem:** Handles communication with external devices
  - Input devices (keyboard, mouse, sensors)
  - Output devices (monitor, printer, speakers)
  - I/O controllers and interfaces

- **Control Unit:** Coordinates the operation of all components
  - Generates control signals
  - Manages instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle
  - Handles timing and synchronization

These blocks are interconnected through system buses (data bus, address bus, control bus) that enable communication and data transfer between components.

### 2. **Describe the instruction execution cycle in detail with RTL interpretation.**

**Answer:**
The instruction execution cycle consists of several phases:

**1. Fetch Phase:**
```
PC → MAR
Memory[MAR] → MDR
MDR → IR
PC + instruction_length → PC
```

**2. Decode Phase:**
```
IR[opcode] → Control Unit
IR[operand_fields] → Address calculation logic
```

**3. Execute Phase (varies by instruction type):**
For ADD R1, R2, R3:
```
R2 → ALU_input_A
R3 → ALU_input_B
ALU_input_A + ALU_input_B → ALU_output
ALU_output → R1
```

**4. Store/Writeback Phase:**
```
Result → Destination register/memory
Update status flags if required
```

This cycle repeats continuously during program execution.

### 3. **Compare and contrast different addressing modes with examples.**

**Answer:**
Addressing modes determine how operand addresses are calculated:

**1. Immediate Addressing:**
- Operand is part of instruction
- Example: `ADD R1, #5` (Add immediate value 5 to R1)
- Fast execution, limited range

**2. Direct Addressing:**
- Address of operand given directly
- Example: `LOAD R1, 1000` (Load from memory address 1000)
- Simple, limited address space

**3. Indirect Addressing:**
- Address field contains address of address
- Example: `LOAD R1, (1000)` (Load from address stored at 1000)
- Flexible, slower execution

**4. Register Addressing:**
- Operand in register
- Example: `ADD R1, R2` (Add contents of R2 to R1)
- Fastest, limited number of registers

**5. Index/Displacement Addressing:**
- Effective address = Base + Index + Displacement
- Example: `LOAD R1, 100(R2)` (Load from address R2+100)
- Useful for arrays and structures

### 4. **Explain signed number representation methods and their advantages/disadvantages.**

**Answer:**

**1. Sign-Magnitude:**
- MSB represents sign (0=+, 1=-)
- Remaining bits represent magnitude
- Range: -(2^(n-1)-1) to +(2^(n-1)-1)
- Disadvantages: Two representations for zero, complex arithmetic

**2. 1's Complement:**
- Negative numbers: Invert all bits of positive number
- Range: -(2^(n-1)-1) to +(2^(n-1)-1)
- Disadvantages: Two zeros, end-around carry needed

**3. 2's Complement:**
- Negative numbers: Invert all bits and add 1
- Range: -2^(n-1) to +(2^(n-1)-1)
- Advantages: Single zero, simple arithmetic operations
- Most widely used in modern computers

### 5. **Design a 4-bit carry look-ahead adder and explain its advantages over ripple carry adder.**

**Answer:**

**Carry Look-ahead Adder Design:**
```
Generate: Gi = Ai · Bi
Propagate: Pi = Ai ⊕ Bi

Carry equations:
C1 = G0 + P0·C0
C2 = G1 + P1·G0 + P1·P0·C0
C3 = G2 + P2·G1 + P2·P1·G0 + P2·P1·P0·C0
C4 = G3 + P3·G2 + P3·P2·G1 + P3·P2·P1·G0 + P3·P2·P1·P0·C0

Sum: Si = Pi ⊕ Ci
```

**Advantages over Ripple Carry:**
- **Speed:** Constant time O(1) vs O(n) for ripple carry
- **Parallelism:** All carries computed simultaneously
- **Predictable timing:** No dependency on input patterns

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity:** More hardware required
- **Cost:** Higher gate count and routing complexity

### 6. **Explain computer arithmetic operations: multiplication using Booth's algorithm.**

**Answer:**

**Booth's Multiplication Algorithm:**
Used for signed binary multiplication, reduces the number of additions.

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. Initialize: A = 0, Q = multiplicand, M = multiplier, Q-1 = 0
2. For each bit position (n iterations):
   - Check Q0 and Q-1
   - If Q0Q-1 = 01: A = A + M
   - If Q0Q-1 = 10: A = A - M
   - If Q0Q-1 = 00 or 11: No operation
   - Arithmetic right shift AQQ-1

**Example: 3 × (-4) using 4-bit representation:**
```
M = 0011 (3), Q = 1100 (-4), A = 0000, Q-1 = 0

Step 1: Q0Q-1 = 00, shift right: A = 0000, Q = 0110, Q-1 = 0
Step 2: Q0Q-1 = 01, A = A + M = 0011, shift: A = 0001, Q = 1011, Q-1 = 0
Step 3: Q0Q-1 = 11, shift right: A = 0000, Q = 1101, Q-1 = 1
Step 4: Q0Q-1 = 10, A = A - M = 1101, shift: A = 1110, Q = 1110, Q-1 = 1

Result: AQ = 11101110 = -12 (correct)
```

### 7. **Describe floating-point representation (IEEE 754) and arithmetic operations.**

**Answer:**

**IEEE 754 Single Precision (32-bit):**
```
| Sign (1) | Exponent (8) | Mantissa (23) |
|    S     |      E       |       M       |
```

**Components:**
- **Sign bit:** 0 = positive, 1 = negative
- **Exponent:** Biased by 127 (excess-127)
- **Mantissa:** Fractional part with implicit leading 1

**Representation:**
Value = (-1)^S × (1.M) × 2^(E-127)

**Floating-Point Addition Algorithm:**
1. Align mantissas (shift smaller number)
2. Add/subtract mantissas
3. Normalize result
4. Round if necessary
5. Check for overflow/underflow

**Example: Add 1.5 + 2.25**
```
1.5 = 0 01111111 10000000000000000000000
2.25 = 0 10000000 00100000000000000000000

Align: 1.5 → 0.75 × 2^1
Add: 0.75 + 2.25 = 3.0
Result: 3.0 = 0 10000000 10000000000000000000000
```

## Module 3: Pipelining & Parallel Processors (10 Hours)

### 14. **Explain the concept of instruction pipelining with a 5-stage pipeline example.**

**Answer:**

**5-Stage Pipeline:**
1. **IF (Instruction Fetch):** Fetch instruction from memory
2. **ID (Instruction Decode):** Decode instruction and read registers
3. **EX (Execute):** Perform ALU operations
4. **MEM (Memory Access):** Access data memory if needed

Time:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Inst1:  IF ID EX MEM WB
Inst2:     IF ID EX  MEM WB
Inst3:        IF ID  EX  MEM WB
Inst4:           IF  ID  EX  MEM WB
Inst5:              IF  ID  EX  MEM WB
```

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Throughput:** 1 instruction per clock cycle (after initial fill)
- **Speedup:** Approaches number of pipeline stages
- **Efficiency:** Throughput / (Number of stages × Clock frequency)

**Pipeline Benefits:**

- Better resource utilization
- Overlapped execution

### 15. **Analyze different types of pipeline hazards and their solutions.**

**Answer:**

**1. Structural Hazards:**
- **Cause:** Resource conflicts
- **Example:** Single memory for instructions and data
- **Solutions:** 
  - Duplicate resources
  - Separate instruction and data caches
  - Pipeline stalls

**2. Data Hazards:**

**RAW (Read After Write):** True dependency
```assembly
ADD R1, R2, R3  ; R1 = R2 + R3
SUB R4, R1, R5  ; R4 = R1 - R5 (depends on R1)
```

**WAW (Write After Write):** Output dependency
```assembly
ADD R1, R2, R3  ; R1 = R2 + R3
MUL R1, R4, R5  ; R1 = R4 × R5 (overwrites R1)
```

**WAR (Write After Read):** Anti-dependency
```assembly
SUB R4, R1, R5  ; R4 = R1 - R5 (reads R1)
ADD R1, R2, R3  ; R1 = R2 + R3 (writes R1)
```

**Solutions:**
- **Forwarding/Bypassing:** Pass results directly between stages
- **Pipeline stalls:** Insert bubbles when necessary
- **Register renaming:** Use different physical registers

**3. Control Hazards:**
- **Cause:** Branch instructions change program flow
- **Solutions:**
  - **Branch prediction:** Predict branch outcome
  - **Delayed branch:** Execute useful instruction in branch delay slot
  - **Branch target buffer:** Cache branch target addresses

**Forwarding Example:**
```
EX/MEM → ID/EX (forward ALU result)
MEM/WB → ID/EX (forward memory result)
MEM/WB → EX/MEM (forward for store instructions)
```

### 16. **Calculate pipeline performance with hazards and stalls.**

**Answer:**

**Performance Calculation:**

**Without Pipeline:**
- Instruction time = Sum of all stage delays
- Total time = Number of instructions × Instruction time

**With Perfect Pipeline:**
- Total time = (Pipeline depth - 1) + Number of instructions

**With Hazards:**
- Include stall cycles due to hazards
- Total time = Ideal time + Stall cycles

**Example Calculation:**
```
5-stage pipeline, each stage = 1 ns
10 instructions to execute

Without pipeline: 10 × 5 = 50 ns
Perfect pipeline: (5-1) + 10 = 14 ns
With 3 stalls: 14 + 3 = 17 ns

Speedup = 50/17 = 2.94
Efficiency = 2.94/5 = 58.8%
```

**CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) with stalls:**
CPI = 1 + Stall cycles per instruction

## Module 4: Memory Organization (6 Hours)

### 19. **Explain memory interleaving and its benefits.**

**Answer:**

**Memory Interleaving:**
- Divide memory into multiple independent banks
- Consecutive addresses in different banks
- Banks can operate simultaneously

**Types:**

**1. Low-order Interleaving:**
- LSBs select bank number
- Better for sequential access
```
Address: Bank (4-way interleaving)
0000:    0
0001:    1  
0002:    2
0003:    3
0004:    0
0005:    1
```

**2. High-order Interleaving:**
- MSBs select bank number
- Better for random access
```
Address: Bank (4-way interleaving)
0000-3FFF: Bank 0
4000-7FFF: Bank 1
8000-BFFF: Bank 2
C000-FFFF: Bank 3
```

**Benefits:**
- **Increased bandwidth:** Multiple simultaneous accesses

### 20. **Analyze cache memory design parameters and their trade-offs.**

**Answer:**

**Cache Design Parameters:**

**1. Cache Size:**
- **Larger cache:** Higher hit rate, more cost/complexity, longer access time
- **Smaller cache:** Lower cost, faster access, higher miss rate

**2. Block Size:**
- **Larger blocks:** Better spatial locality, longer miss penalty, fewer blocks
- **Smaller blocks:** Less transfer time, more blocks, less spatial locality

**3. Associativity:**
- **Direct mapped:** Simple hardware, fast access, more conflicts
- **Fully associative:** No conflict misses, complex hardware, slower
- **Set associative:** Compromise between above

**4. Write Policy:**
- **Write-through:** Simple, consistent, higher traffic
- **Write-back:** Less traffic, complex, inconsistent

**Trade-off Analysis:**
```
Parameter     | Increase Effect        | Decrease Effect
Cache Size    | ↑Hit rate, ↑Cost      | ↓Cost, ↑Miss rate
Block Size    | ↑Spatial locality     | ↓Miss penalty
Associativity | ↓Conflict misses      | ↑Access time
```

**Optimal Design Considerations:**
- Application access patterns
- Cost constraints
- Performance requirements
- Technology limitations

### 21. **Compare different cache mapping functions with examples.**

**Answer:**

**1. Direct Mapping:**
- Each memory block maps to exactly one cache line
- Mapping: Cache line = (Memory address) mod (Number of cache lines)

**Example (8 cache lines, 4-word blocks):**
```
Memory Block → Cache Line
0 → 0, 8 → 0, 16 → 0 (conflict)
1 → 1, 9 → 1, 17 → 1 (conflict)
...
```

**Advantages:** Simple, fast access
**Disadvantages:** High conflict misses

**2. Fully Associative Mapping:**
- Any memory block can be placed in any cache line
- Requires comparison with all cache tags

**Example:**
```
Memory blocks 0, 8, 16 can be placed in any cache line
No conflicts, but complex hardware
```

**Advantages:** No conflict misses
**Disadvantages:** Complex hardware, slower access

**3. Set Associative Mapping:**
- Compromise between direct and fully associative
- Cache divided into sets, each set has multiple lines

**Example (2-way set associative, 4 sets):**
```
Memory Block → Set → Available lines in set
0, 8, 16 → Set 0 → Lines 0, 1
1, 9, 17 → Set 1 → Lines 2, 3
...
```

**Advantages:** Reduced conflicts, reasonable complexity
**Disadvantages:** More complex than direct mapping

### 22. **Compare different cache replacement algorithms with examples.**

**Answer:**

**1. Random Replacement:**
- Randomly select line to replace
- Simple hardware implementation
- Unpredictable performance

**2. FIFO (First In, First Out):**
- Replace oldest line in set
- Easy to implement with counters
- May replace frequently used data

**3. LRU (Least Recently Used):**
- Replace least recently accessed line
- Best approximation to optimal algorithm
- Complex for high associativity

**4. LFU (Least Frequently Used):**
- Replace line with lowest access count
- Good for some access patterns
- Requires frequency counters

**Example (4-way set associative, LRU):**
```
Access sequence: A, B, C, D, B, E, A

Set contents over time:
Initial: [-, -, -, -]
A:       [A, -, -, -]        LRU order: A
B:       [A, B, -, -]        LRU order: A, B
C:       [A, B, C, -]        LRU order: A, B, C
D:       [A, B, C, D]        LRU order: A, B, C, D
B:       [A, B, C, D]        LRU order: A, C, D, B (B becomes MRU)
E:       [E, B, C, D]        LRU order: C, D, B, E (replace A)
A:       [E, B, A, D]        LRU order: D, B, E, A (replace C)
```

**Implementation Complexity:**
- **Random:** Minimal hardware
- **FIFO:** Simple counters
- **LRU:** Complex for >2-way, approximations used
- **LFU:** Frequency counters, overflow issues

### 23. **Analyze cache write policies and their impact on performance.**

**Answer:**

**Write Policies:**

**1. Write-Through:**
- Every write updates both cache and memory
- Cache and memory always consistent
- Simple implementation

**Advantages:**
- Memory always up-to-date
- Simple coherency in multiprocessor systems
- Easy to implement

**Disadvantages:**
- High memory traffic
- Slower write operations
- Memory bandwidth bottleneck

**2. Write-Back (Write-Behind):**
- Writes only update cache initially
- Memory updated when cache line replaced
- Requires dirty bit per cache line

**Advantages:**
- Faster write operations
- Reduced memory traffic
- Better performance for write-intensive applications

**Disadvantages:**
- Memory inconsistent with cache
- Complex coherency protocols
- Risk of data loss on system failure

**Write Miss Policies:**

**1. Write Allocate:**
- Load block into cache on write miss
- Then perform write
- Good for spatial locality

**2. No Write Allocate:**
- Write directly to memory on write miss
- Don't load block into cache
- Better for single writes

**Performance Impact Analysis:**
```
Metric              | Write-Through | Write-Back
Average Write Time  | Higher        | Lower
Memory Traffic      | Higher        | Lower
Consistency         | Always        | Delayed
Implementation      | Simple        | Complex
```

**Write Buffer Optimization:**
- Buffer writes between cache and memory
- Allow processor to continue while writing
- Reduces write-through penalty
